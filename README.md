## Description
This application is used to create a team profile from a series of command line prompts. By entering your teams details, it will create a well formatted HTML page displaying your team. You can add as many employees to the team as you want and the HTML template will handle the rest.

## Installation
To install the application, clone or download the folder and open it in your favourite text editor. Then run "npm i" in the command line to install all of the dependencies of the application.
## Usage
To use the application once it is installed, type "node index.js" into the command line. This will then open a series of prompts, first asking for the managers details, and then looping through adding other employees to the team. Following all of the prompts until you've added your whole team and then selecting "no" when asked if you want to add another member, this will create the HTML for the webpage which can then be opened in the browser.
